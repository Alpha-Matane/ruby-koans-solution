# Ruby Koans Solution

The Ruby koans written by neo (https://github.com/neo ) and solved by me (https://github.com/Alpha_Matane).
It was a set of Ruby code flashing different errors upon launch. Now the only thing it does is outputting "Mountains are again merely mountains", which, I suppose, was the original purpose. 
I answered the questions as well.
